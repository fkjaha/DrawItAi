This is a Game inspired by Google's Quick Draw Ai model.
This model is used to recognize drawn doodles.
So, I decided to make a quick game where you have a few rounds where you have to draw a thing so that AI will correctly guess what it is.

Game made using:
Engine: Unity
Plugin for AI intergation: Unity Sentis Package
AI Model: Google Quick Draw

To play the game you can:
1. Play built verision
- download archive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aLxIZcpUcVy6izqh7Xcqfre-cq4-7jqQ/view?usp=sharing 
- unpack it
- run DrawIt.exe
- Play

2. Download and run Unity Project (In case no want not just to play but also see how it works) + (Requires Unity Hub and Unity Engine v.2023.2.0b17 installed on your PC)
- Download repository
